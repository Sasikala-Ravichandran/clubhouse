##Clubhouse

This clubhouse app lets members to write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

Built this app to learn about authentication and authorization mechanism. This app is one of the exercise from ['The Odin Project'](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication).
